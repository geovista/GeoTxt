# GeoTxt
GeoTxt is a scalable geoparsing system for the recognition and geolocation of place names in unstructured text. GeoTxt offers six named entity recognition (NER) algorithms for place name recognition, and utilizes Apache Solr for the indexing, ranking, and retrieval of toponyms, enabling scalable geoparsing for streaming text. GeoTxt offers a flexible application programming interface (API), generating a GeoJSON FeatureCollection as output.

### Tutorial

The codes in this project includse GeoTxt as well as the GeoAnnotator Web API / Java Core code. 

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

We plan on enriching the instructions for building the system from source soon.
